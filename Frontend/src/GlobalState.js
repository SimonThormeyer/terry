/*
 USED LIKE THIS IN ANY FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT:
 ============================================================
 import { useGlobalState } from "../GlobalState"
 const [variableName, setVariable] = useGlobalState('variableName')
 ============================================================
 now you can access the state content unter variableName and update it with setVariable(newValue)
 important: all components using the state (like shown above) will be listerners to this variable and re-render on update!
 Functions that should be available globally can be part of the GlobalState as well.
